# GPT_PPO
# Applying PPO on the Attention Mechanism of the GPT-2 model

# This code aims to fine-tune a GPT-2 model for a custom text generation task using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is a reinforcement learning approach. Here's a detailed theoretical explanation of the code:

1- Importing necessary libraries: The code imports the required PyTorch, transformers, and numpy libraries to build the custom environment, model, and training classes.

2- TextGenerationEnvironment: This class creates an environment for the text generation task, where the agent interacts to generate text. It initializes the GPT-2 tokenizer and model, and defines methods to generate text, reset the environment, and take a step (i.e., append a token to the current text).

3- ModifiedGPT: This class extends the GPT-2 model to work with reinforcement learning. It adds an additional linear layer (action_layer) and softmax activation function to produce action probabilities for the tokens in the vocabulary. The forward method computes these action probabilities and, if provided, the cross-entropy loss using the ground-truth labels.

4- RewardFunction: This class defines a reward function based on the negative perplexity of the generated text. It takes a reference text and initializes the GPT-2 tokenizer and model. The __call__ method calculates the perplexity of the generated text using the GPT-2 model and returns the negative perplexity as the reward.

5- RolloutStorage: This class stores the rollout data (observations, actions, action probabilities, rewards, and dones) during the agent's interaction with the environment. It also computes the returns and advantages, which are used for updating the policy during training.

6- PPOTrainer: This class trains the agent using the PPO algorithm. It initializes the environment, model, reward function, and other hyperparameters. The train method collects rollout data by having the agent interact with the environment and then updates the policy using multiple epochs of minibatch updates.

7- main() function: The main function initializes the environment, model, reward function, and trainer. It then trains the agent for a specified number of steps and saves the trained model's weights.

8- generate_text() function: This function takes a text prompt, model, tokenizer, and desired text length and generates text using the trained model. It tokenizes the input prompt and passes it to the model to generate the output text.

9- Script execution: The script, when executed, runs the main function to train the model and then uses the generate_text function to generate text using the fine-tuned model.

# The main idea behind this code is to fine-tune a GPT-2 model for a custom text generation task using reinforcement learning, specifically the PPO algorithm. The agent learns to generate text similar to a given reference text by interacting with the custom environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards from the custom reward function.
