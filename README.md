# GPT_PPO
# Applying PPO on the Attention Mechanism of the GPT-2 model

# This code aims to fine-tune a GPT-2 model for a custom text generation task using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which is a reinforcement learning approach. Here's a detailed theoretical explanation of the code:

1- Importing necessary libraries: The code imports the required PyTorch, transformers, and numpy libraries to build the custom environment, model, and training classes.

2- TextGenerationEnvironment: This class creates an environment for the text generation task, where the agent interacts to generate text. It initializes the GPT-2 tokenizer and model, and defines methods to generate text, reset the environment, and take a step (i.e., append a token to the current text).

3- ModifiedGPT: This class extends the GPT-2 model to work with reinforcement learning. It adds an additional linear layer (action_layer) and softmax activation function to produce action probabilities for the tokens in the vocabulary. The forward method computes these action probabilities and, if provided, the cross-entropy loss using the ground-truth labels.

4- RewardFunction: This class defines a reward function based on the negative perplexity of the generated text. It takes a reference text and initializes the GPT-2 tokenizer and model. The __call__ method calculates the perplexity of the generated text using the GPT-2 model and returns the negative perplexity as the reward.

5- RolloutStorage: This class stores the rollout data (observations, actions, action probabilities, rewards, and dones) during the agent's interaction with the environment. It also computes the returns and advantages, which are used for updating the policy during training.

6- PPOTrainer: This class trains the agent using the PPO algorithm. It initializes the environment, model, reward function, and other hyperparameters. The train method collects rollout data by having the agent interact with the environment and then updates the policy using multiple epochs of minibatch updates.

7- main() function: The main function initializes the environment, model, reward function, and trainer. It then trains the agent for a specified number of steps and saves the trained model's weights.

8- generate_text() function: This function takes a text prompt, model, tokenizer, and desired text length and generates text using the trained model. It tokenizes the input prompt and passes it to the model to generate the output text.

9- Script execution: The script, when executed, runs the main function to train the model and then uses the generate_text function to generate text using the fine-tuned model.

# The main idea behind this code is to fine-tune a GPT-2 model for a custom text generation task using reinforcement learning, specifically the PPO algorithm. The agent learns to generate text similar to a given reference text by interacting with the custom environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards from the custom reward function.


# GPT_PPO V2 
# This code is an implementation of a custom reinforcement learning environment for text generation using the GPT-2 model and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the training algorithm. The main components of the code are:

1- TextGenerationEnvironment: A class defining the environment for text generation using GPT-2. It provides methods for generating text, resetting the environment, and taking a step in the environment given an action.

2- ModifiedGPT: A class that modifies the GPT-2 model to include an additional action layer and softmax activation function. This is used to generate a probability distribution over the possible actions (tokens) given an input text.

3- CustomRewardFunction: A class that defines a custom reward function for the reinforcement learning problem. It takes into account the perplexity of the generated text, its semantic similarity to a reference text, and applies a penalty if the generated text exceeds the maximum allowed length.

4- RolloutStorage: A class that manages the storage of rollout data (observations, actions, action probabilities, rewards, and done flags) collected during the training process.

5- PPOTrainer: A class that implements the PPO algorithm for training the modified GPT-2 model in the text generation environment. It includes methods for training, updating model parameters, and managing the rollout storage.

6- main(): The main function initializes the environment, model, and PPO trainer, and starts the training process. After training, it saves the trained model to a file.

7- generate_text(): A function that generates text given a prompt using the trained model and GPT-2 tokenizer.

8- The code first sets up a text generation environment using GPT-2, a modified GPT-2 model, and a custom reward function based on a reference text. It then trains the model using the PPO algorithm for a specified number of steps. After training, the fine-tuned model is saved to a file. Finally, the script demonstrates how to use the trained model to generate text given a prompt.

# When run, the code will train the modified GPT-2 model using the PPO algorithm in the text generation environment. After training, it will save the fine-tuned model weights and demonstrate generating text given a prompt using the trained model.
